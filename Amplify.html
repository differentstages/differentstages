  <p><br><br><font face="Candara" size="5">From 6pm March 5th to 6pm March 6th, over 500 Central Texas non-profits will have the opportunity to participate in a 3rd annual fundraising marathon, and <b>Different Stages</b> needs your support.
</font></p><font face="Candara" size="4"><p>

This is your chance to help maintain and grow one of Austin's root theatre experiences. Whether you are a performer who has had the opportunity to experience rich theatrical productions not otherwise offered, or you are a long time member of the Different Stages audience, you understand the unique kinds of artistic endeavors this 30-year old production company offers. Please help us to continue to produce quality shows that enrich the community, and allow us to "up-the-ante" by being able to offer compensation for our talented local actors and directors so that we can continue to attract the best talents in the area and offer quality theatre, all on a shoestring budget.
</p><p>

Amplify Austin officially kicks off March 5th at 6 PM and ends 6pm March 6th. Pledging ahead of time is easy and convenient, and your account will not be charged until after the event.
